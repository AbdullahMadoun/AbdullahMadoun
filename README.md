### 🎓 Software Engineering Student @ KFUPM | AI Specialization
**Riyadh, Saudi Arabia**

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a **final-year Software Engineering student** who gets genuinely excited about building AI systems that actually work in the real world. Whether it's teaching computers to recognize food in cafeterias or helping Arabic signers communicate through AI, I love turning complex problems into elegant solutions.

**When I'm not coding, you'll find me:**
- ♟️ Playing chess
- 🌌 Pointing my camera at the night sky trying to capture galaxies 
- 📚 Tutoring students in math or mentoring fellow developers
- 🤝 Leading community volunteer projects

## 💡 What Gets Me Out of Bed

I'm passionate about **AI/ML that solves real problems**. Not just academic exercises, but systems that people actually use:

- 🤖 **Building production-ready AI** with PyTorch, Transformers, and Graph Neural Networks
- 🎯 **Designing end-to-end ML pipelines** from messy data to deployed models  
- 🔍 **Hunting for patterns** in data that lead to actual business impact
- 🏆 **Winning hackathons** by thinking differently (3 wins and counting!)
- 🧠 **Problem-solving** - whether it's debugging code, optimizing algorithms, or finding checkmate in 3 moves

## 🚀 Cool Stuff I've Built

### 🍽️ **Food Recognition & Pricing System** | University-Funded Research
*Currently Working On This · Feb 2025 - Present*

Building an AI system for KFUPM cafeterias that's actually pretty smart:
- 🎯 **Cut manual labeling by 75%** using semi-supervised Vision Transformers on 130K images (because ain't nobody got time for labeling that manually)
- 🚀 **Real-time pricing** with YOLO object detection - point camera at tray, get instant price
- 🔄 **Self-learning system** - recognizes new dishes without retraining (yes, it even learned about the new shawarma)

**Why this matters:** Faster checkout lines, fewer pricing errors, and I get to eat my lunch while my model does the work.

### 🤟 **Arabic Sign Language AI** | Research Project

Helping bridge communication gaps for Arabic-speaking deaf community:
- 🧠 **15.7% Word Error Rate** - that's pretty good for continuous sign language!
- 📊 Built a **Graph Neural Network** that treats the human skeleton like a... well, graph
- 🎯 **Hybrid architecture** combining TCN + Transformers for temporal dynamics

**The challenge:** Arabic sign language is way different from ASL, and continuous recognition is harder than isolated signs. We're getting there!

### 🏆 **Tabular ML Competition Winner** | Beat 30+ Teams

- 🥇 **First place** with 82% F1-score on imbalanced data (5% better than second place)
- 🔥 **TabPFN 2.5** + focal loss + clever feature engineering = victory
- 💪 Lesson learned: Sometimes the fanciest model isn't the answer - understanding your data is

## 💼 Experience That Shaped Me

### 📊 **Data Analyst Intern** @ Keeta Business
*Summer 2025*

**The mission:** Find fraud. Lots of it.

- 🕵️ Engineered risk metrics that **caught 400+ fraudulent cases** (satisfying? Very.)
- 🗄️ Built **Power BI data model** unifying messy multilingual sources
- ⚡ Cut analysis time from hours to minutes for the ops team

**What I learned:** Real-world data is messy, and cleaning it is 80% of the job. Also, fraud detection is basically detective work with Python.

## 🏅 Wins & Cool Moments

🥇 **ByteBank Hackathon Winner** - Built a content recommendation engine using video transcript vectorization (think TikTok algorithm, but for a fintech platform)

🥇 **Four Principles Competition Winner** - Designed AI-powered supply chain optimization. We value-stream-mapped the entire logistics flow and found bottlenecks worth millions

🥇 **KFUPM Math Contest Champion** - Beat everyone in a speed algebra competition (all 3 rounds 🔥)

♟️ **2x National Chess Gold, 1x Silver** - Strategic thinking under pressure is my jam. Also learned that time pressure brings out your true self (and panic moves)

🌌 **Astrophotographer** - Captured Andromeda galaxy with basic equipment and lots of patience. Space is cool, y'all.
